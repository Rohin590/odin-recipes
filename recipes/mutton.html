    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Mutton <em>kosha</em> or <em>kosha mangsho</em> is an iconic Bengali delicacy.
        This dish involves slow cooking a gravy over a low flame for a very long time 
        to get a rich dark-brown gravy and melt-in-the-mouth mutton pieces. It can be
        served with <em>polao</em> or <em>porota</em>.</p>

    <h3> Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1kg mutton</li>
        <li>100g onions</li>
        <li>5g garlic</li>
        <li>100g yoghurt</li>
        <li>15g salt</li>
        <li>5g tumeric salt</li>
        <li>3g shahi garam masala powder</li>
        <li>20g mustard oil</li>
        <li>4cm cinammon</li>
        <li>10pcs green cardamom</li>
        <li>1pc black cardamom</li>
        <li>10 pcs cloves</li>
        <li>4pcs dried red chilies</li>
        <li>6pcs bay leaves</li>
        <li>400g onions(sliced)</li>
        <li>40g ginger paste</li>
        <li>10g garlic</li>
        <li>20g green chilies</li>
        <li>3g coriander powder</li>
        <li>3g cumin powder</li>
        <li>3g kashmiri red chilli powder</li>
        <li>150-200g yoghurt</li>
        <li>8g salt</li>
        <li>10g sugar</li>
        <li>1litre hot water</li>
        <li>5g ghee</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>For the marinade, add 100 g quartered onions, 5 g roughly chopped garlic,
            100 g yoghurt, 15 g salt, turmeric, and shahi garam masala to a grinder jar.
            Blitz to form a smooth paste.</li>
        <li>Coat all the mutton pieces with the marinade, making sure to get into 
            all the nooks and crannies of the meat. 
            Cover and allow the mutton to marinate 
            in the refrigerator for about 8 hours.</li>
        <li>Coming to the prep: Cut 400 g onions into thin slices. For this recipe, 
            sliced onions define the texture of the curry. Diced, chopped, 
            or pur√©ed onions won't give you the same result. Using a mortar 
            and pestle, crush together 10 g garlic and 20 g green chillies 
            to a paste. For ease while stirring later on, you may also cut 
            all the bay leaves in 3-cm sections using a pair of scissors.</li>
        <li>Heat a large kadai and add mustard oil to it. Once the oil has 
            started to smoke lightly and changed colour to a pale yellow,
            add the dried red chillies, bay leaves, cinnamon, green cardamom,
            black cardamom, and cloves.</li>
        <li>Add the onions and fry them on medium flame for about 15 minutes until 
            they are light brown in colour. Then, add the ginger paste, and garlic
            and green chilli paste, and fry for another 5 minutes. Keep the flame
            medium to low, depending on whether your onions are sticking to the
            pan or not, and stir often. We want to fry the spices as well as 
            develop colour on the onions. Next, add the dry spices (coriander,
            cumin, and red chilli) mixed with 100 g of water. Continue frying 
            the onions along with the spices for about 15 more minutes. By 
            now (it's been 30 minutes since we started), your onions should
            have taken on a reddish-brown colour and the spices started 
            releasing their oils.</li>
        <li>Add the marinated mutton to the pan. The mutton has been in the fridge, 
            so it is cold. Raise the heat and mix everything thoroughly. Fry the mutton,
            stirring frequently to check that it's not sticking to the pan, for 15 minutes
            on high heat. Beat 150-200 g yoghurt until it is lump-free and add it 
            to the pan. Also add 8 g salt and 10 g sugar at this point. Mix everything
            and keep frying. Once the moisture (from the cold mutton and yoghurt) 
            starts to dry out, drop the heat to medium.</li>
        <li>There's not much to it now. On medium heat, 
            for the next 75 to 90 minutes, repeat the following steps:
            <ul>
                <li>Add a splash of hot water to the pan (~30 ml at a time)</li>
                <li>Stir it in</li>
                <li>Cover the pan and cook for a minute</li>
                <li>Uncover and stir everything thoroughly</li>
            </ul>
        </li> 
        <li>Once you are happy with the colour, add as much water as you'd like for 
            the gravy/curry. Also add about 4 slit green chillies for flavour. Cover 
            and cook until the mutton is tender. You should be able to tear it apart 
            with two fingers.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and top off with a little bit of ghee. Cover and let it 
            rest for about 2 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve with fried rice, <em>luchi</em> or <em>polao</em>.</li>
    </ol>
